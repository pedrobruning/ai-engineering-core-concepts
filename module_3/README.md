# Module 3: Prompt Evaluation

## Course Content
This module covers evaluation workflows, test dataset generation, and different grading approaches including Human, Model, and Code-based grading. I learned about Evaluation Driven Development (EDD) as introduced by Chip Huyen, and implemented model-based grading for AWS-related tasks.

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Evaluation Driven Development (EDD)**: A methodology introduced by Chip Huyen in her latest book "AI Engineering" for systematic prompt evaluation
- **Three Types of Grading**:
  - **Human-based grading**: Manual evaluation by humans
  - **Model-based grading**: Using AI models to evaluate outputs (implemented)
  - **Code-based grading**: Automated evaluation using code (next steps)

## Lessons
- [x] **Lesson 3.1**: Evaluation Workflows and EDD Overview
- [x] **Lesson 3.2**: Test Dataset Generation for AWS Tasks
- [x] **Lesson 3.3**: Model-based Grading Implementation
- [ ] **Lesson 3.4**: Code-based Grading (Next Steps)
- [ ] **Lesson 3.5**: Evaluation Best Practices and Exercises

## Exercises
- [x] Exercise 3.1: Create Evaluation Dataset (AWS-focused)
- [x] Exercise 3.2: Implement Model-based Evaluation
- [ ] Exercise 3.3: Build Code-based Grading System
- [ ] Exercise 3.4: Practical Evaluation Workflow Exercises

## Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ **Completed**: Model-based grading system for AWS tasks
- ‚úÖ **Completed**: Dataset generation for Python, JSON, and Regex tasks
- üîÑ **In Progress**: Code-based grading implementation
- ‚è≥ **Pending**: Evaluation exercises and quiz

## Module Files
- `001_prompt_evals.ipynb` - Main implementation notebook
- `dataset.json` - Generated evaluation dataset with AWS tasks

## Next Steps
1. Implement code-based grading system
2. Complete evaluation exercises
3. Take module quiz
4. Apply evaluation techniques to other domains
