The Mapuche communities of southern Chile demonstrate remarkable resilience through ceremonial practices that simultaneously preserve ancestral knowledge and negotiate contemporary social transformations. By analyzing ritual dance, oral storytelling, and material culture, researchers can trace intricate pathways of cultural transmission and resistance against historical marginalization."
